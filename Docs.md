### Hey, thereðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

The technical writing opportunities resource exists both as a notion template and as a GitHub Repository as well. You can always use both of them, and they are available for free. The Notion template is better to customize and to find the best one by using filtering tabs, while the GitHub resource makes it easier for others to contribute.

Before diving into the resources, I highly suggest you go through the small documentation below to better understand how to use the template to get the maximum output from it. If you're busy, here are some important points in no particular order.

-   Most of the opportunities are open all day and every day, but some may have incomplete data or outdated information about the program status or contact information. If you happen to know the updated information, feel free to contribute by opening a pull request with valid proof.
-   All opportunities are in the computer science domain, and submissions should be made through online forms or by mailing the editor, depending on the organization.
-   The given remuneration is based on the available data on the internet and can be used as an estimate. The remuneration is decided by the editorial team during the publication of the article.
-   Some opportunities may be inactive, but they are still mentioned in the resource because there's a chance that they may resume.
